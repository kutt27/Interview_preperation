### Arithmetic Operation

To add two operands in java we use;

```java
public class Arithmetic{
    public static void main(){
        int a = 10;
        int b = 5;
        System.out.println("Addition results are " + (a + b));
        System.out.println("Substraction results are " + (a - b));
        System.out.println("Multiplication results are " + (a * b));
        System.out.println("Division results are " + (a / b));
        System.out.println("Modulo results are " + (a % b));
    }
}
```
